### Introduction
In this project, we aim to analyze and gain insights from real estate data scraped from Immobilienscout24, a popular property listing website. By leveraging data scraping techniques, we will collect information such as property details, prices, locations, and other relevant attributes.

#### Objectives:
* Data Collection: Using web scraping tools like Python’s Requests and BeautifulSoup, we will gather a dataset comprising various properties listed on Immobilienscout24.

* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): We will perform EDA to understand the structure and characteristics of the dataset. This includes examining distributions, identifying outliers, and uncovering correlations between different features.

* Machine Learning Modeling: Implementing machine learning algorithms, we aim to predict key aspects such as property prices based on factors like location, size, and amenities. Techniques will include regression for price prediction and potentially classification or clustering for other insights.

* Visualization: Utilizing Matplotlib for Python and Tableau for more interactive visualizations, we will present our findings effectively. Visual representations will help in understanding trends, patterns, and relationships within the data.

### Tools and Technologies:
* Python: For data scraping (Requests, BeautifulSoup), data analysis (Pandas, NumPy), and machine learning (scikit-learn).
* Matplotlib: For creating static visualizations such as histograms, scatter plots, and line charts.
* Tableau: For building dynamic dashboards and interactive visualizations to explore and communicate insights.

### Project Workflow:
* Data Scraping: Fetching property data from Immobilienscout24, adhering to ethical guidelines and website terms.

* Data Preparation: Cleaning and structuring the scraped data into a suitable format for analysis.

* Exploratory Data Analysis: Exploring statistical summaries and visualizing data distributions to uncover initial insights.

* Machine Learning Implementation: Training and evaluating models to predict property prices or classify properties based on features.

* Visualization and Reporting: Creating visual summaries using Matplotlib and Tableau to showcase findings and conclusions.

Aim of this project, I will have gained practical experience in web scraping, data analysis, machine learning, and data visualization—skills essential for extracting valuable insights from real-world datasets.
